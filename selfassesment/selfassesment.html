<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Completing my coursework throughout
the Computer Science program as well as the development of my ePortfolio has
allowed me to not only sharpen my technical skills but also to clearly define
my professional goals and values. The projects I have worked on have served as
concrete examples of how I have applied my knowledge to real-world problems,
which will be invaluable as I prepare to enter the workforce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Coursework, Professional Goals, and
Competence</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Throughout the programs at SNHU and
the previous universities I attended, I have had the opportunity to apply a
range of concepts in both individual and practical settings. These projects
have helped me understand the importance of clean code, user-centric design,
and robust software engineering practices. For example, my work on the
Event-Tracking App demonstrated my ability to design and implement an
application that balances performance, security, and scalability. This hands-on
experience has solidified my ability to create well-rounded solutions that meet
the needs of users while adhering to industry standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Key Competencies and Skills</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Collaborating in a Team Environment:
While many of my assignments were individual projects, I recognize that
collaboration is a key skill in the workplace. I anticipate that future roles
will require working closely with others, and through independent projects,
I’ve developed strong communication and problem-solving skills that will
support collaboration in a team environment. Though the Event-Tracking App was
developed independently, I understand the importance of communicating with
stakeholders in a professional manner, ensuring that their needs were met and
integrated into the design process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Communicating with Stakeholders:
Throughout my projects, I made an effort to define clear user needs and goals,
ensuring that the software I developed would meet those requirements. I’ve learned
how to present technical concepts in a way that is understandable to
non-technical stakeholders and ensure that their feedback is taken into account
in iterative development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Data Structures and Algorithms: My
coursework required me to apply algorithms to solve complex problems, such as
optimizing database queries and improving login flows for the Event-Tracking
App. I used principles like modularization, error handling, and performance
optimization to refine the app’s structure and ensure efficiency. The knowledge
I gained from these experiences has been essential in ensuring that my
solutions are both scalable and efficient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Software Engineering and Database
Management: The Event-Tracking App allowed me to demonstrate my understanding
of core software engineering principles, such as modular design, secure coding
practices, and database management. I implemented robust error handling and
optimized database queries, which improved performance and ensured the app’s
reliability. Through these tasks, I’ve become more proficient in designing
systems that balance usability, security, and maintainability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Security: Security is a critical
aspect of software development, and my focus on secure coding practices has
been integral to my work. I applied techniques like SQL injection prevention
and password hashing (Bcrypt) to ensure user data is protected. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The artifact in my ePortfolio (the
Event-Tracking App) highlights my ability to develop secure, efficient, and
user-centered applications. Each artifact demonstrates different aspects of my
technical skills, such as database management, secure coding, performance
optimization, and modular software design. These artifacts not only showcase my
ability to create professional-quality software but also demonstrate my approach
to solving complex problems in the field of computer science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The improvements made to the app-such
as enhanced security, optimized database queries, and better error handling-reflect
my growth as a software engineer. These artifacts complement one another, with
each one contributing to a broader understanding of my skills and abilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>In conclusion, my portfolio
reflects the full range of my talents and technical expertise in computer
science. I believe the event tracking app highlights my ability to design,
implement, and refine applications that meet user needs while ensuring
efficiency, security, and scalability. With this foundation, I am prepared to
transition into the workforce and continue developing in the computer science
space.</p>
