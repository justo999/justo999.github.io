<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>1. The artifact I am discussing is
the LoginActivity from an event tracking app I developed during my CS 360
course. The app was designed to allow users to securely log in and manage their
events. In this specific part of the app, the LoginActivity was refactored to
improve its modularity, error handling, and the overall user experience. The
original code was functional but lacked separation of concerns and had minimal
error handling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>2. I selected the LoginActivity
refactor as an artifact for my ePortfolio because it clearly demonstrates my
ability to apply sound software engineering practices, especially in terms of
modularity, error handling, and security. By refactoring the login
functionality, I enhanced the app’s maintainability and scalability, which are
crucial aspects of software development. The code was modularized by breaking
it down into smaller, focused methods like loginUser() and isInputInvalid().
Error handling was significantly improved to ensure that issues during the
login process were caught and communicated clearly to users. This improves both
the robustness and the user experience, which are critical skills in developing
professional-quality applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The artifact was improved by
implementing more organized and readable code, improving security with best
practices (for instance, using parameterized SQL queries), and adding detailed
error logging. The changes are clearly visible in the final LoginActivity.java
code, where I refactored the login flow, added helper methods, and ensured more
efficient user input validation.<br>
3. The process of refactoring the LoginActivity helped me meet several course
outcomes related to software development. Specifically:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Design, develop, and deliver
professional-quality communications: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The refactored code is clearer,
more organized, and follows better development practices. This is reflected not
only in the code structure but also in the way I wrote error messages and
validated user input, ensuring the app provides a smooth user experience. This
demonstrates my ability to develop coherent, technically sound, and
appropriately adapted solutions for mobile applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Design and evaluate computing
solutions using algorithmic principles: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>By refactoring the code, I improved
the underlying algorithms related to user login. For example, the login logic
now includes robust error handling and validation, making the system more
reliable. I also evaluated design choices like separating the login logic from
the UI and using a DatabaseHelper to handle database interactions, which align
with best practices in software development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>4. Reflecting on this, I feel that
the changes I made not only met my initial goals but also improved the overall
quality of the application. This process helped me better understand the
balance between clean code, efficient algorithms, and creating a user-friendly
experience.  <br>
Throughout the process of enhancing the LoginActivity, I learned several key
lessons about software design, modularization, and error handling. The most
significant learning experience came from realizing how separating concerns in
the code (like moving database logic to the DatabaseHelper class) made the code
more maintainable and testable. This was particularly valuable because it
allowed for easier future updates to the app, such as adding features or
improving the login flow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The challenges I faced during this
refactoring included making sure the login flow was both secure and efficient.
For example, I initially had trouble deciding the best way to handle user input
validation. I had to ensure that I provided detailed error messages without
overwhelming the user. After some iteration, I decided to use clear, concise
prompts and structure the logic to check inputs before attempting to query the
database. This made the app more user-friendly and ensured that errors were
caught early in the process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>In summary, the refactoring process
helped me to improve my understanding of modular software design and reinforced
the importance of robust error handling and clear user feedback in
professional-quality applications.</p>
