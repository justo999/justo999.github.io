<p class=MsoNormal>The artifact I'm discussing is an event-tracking mobile
application developed as part of my CS 360 course. This application enables
users to manage and track events, allowing them to securely store event data and
user credentials using SQLite. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface
for adding and viewing events. The app incorporates robust error handling,
optimized database queries, and secure password storage to ensure both security
and performance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it
demonstrates my skills in secure coding practices, database management, and
performance optimization. Through this app, I applied algorithmic principles to
enhance both the security and the efficiency of database operations. A major
improvement I implemented was the addition of hashed password storage,
replacing plaintext storage with Bcrypt hashing. This step ensured that user
passwords would be secure even if the database were compromised. Furthermore, I
implemented detailed logging to monitor database operations, which is crucial
for debugging and maintaining the app in a real-world setting. I also adopted a
more sophisticated migration strategy to preserve user data while updating the
database schema.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The course outcome I aimed to meet with these enhancements
was &quot;Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem
using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards
appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design
choices.&quot; By integrating hashed passwords, I addressed security
vulnerabilities while ensuring that the app's functionality remained intact.
The logging and migration strategies improved the app’s maintainability and
scalability, ensuring it can handle increasing data as it grows. These
enhancements helped optimize the balance between security, performance, and
maintainability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the process of enhancing this artifact, I learned a great
deal about secure coding, specifically regarding the use of password hashing
libraries like Bcrypt to protect user data. I also gained a deeper
understanding of database design, particularly around data migrations and
indexing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In conclusion, enhancing the event-tracking app allowed me
to apply my skills in secure coding practices, performance optimization, and
error handling. The improvements made to the app significantly enhanced its
security, performance, and overall reliability. These changes reflect my
ability to design solutions that balance security, efficiency, and
maintainability, addressing both user needs and software quality standards.</p>
