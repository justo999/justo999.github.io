<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>The artifact that I'm discussing is an
event-tracking mobile application developed during my CS 360 course; which
allows users to manage and track their events, storing data securely using
SQLite and providing a simple interface to add and display events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>I selected this artifact for my
ePortfolio because it represents a comprehensive application of my skills in
algorithms, data structures, and secure coding. The app specifically   demonstrates
my proficiency in database management through its use of SQLite for storing
user credentials and event information. I showcased my understanding of
algorithmic principles by improving the database operations, including
optimizing queries, preventing SQL injection attacks, and adding indexing to
enhance performance. I also implemented robust error handling to ensure
stability in database interactions. The artifact was improved through these
security and performance enhancements, which improved both the app’s reliability
and its ability to scale with growing data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>The course outcome I aimed to meet
with this enhancement was to &quot;design and evaluate computing solutions that
solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science
practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the
trade-offs involved in design choices.&quot; I successfully met this outcome by
applying secure coding practices, optimizing the database for performance, and
handling errors gracefully. The improvements I made to the app addressed both
security concerns, such as SQL injection, and performance issues, such as slow
queries due to missing indexing. By evaluating these trade-offs, I ensured that
the app was both secure and efficient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>While reflecting on the enhancement
process, I gained a deeper understanding of key software development
principles. I learned the importance of secure coding practices, such as
preventing SQL injection through parameterized queries, and how important it is
to optimize database performance through indexing. I also realized how crucial
error handling is in ensuring that the app runs smoothly and can recover from
failures without crashing. The challenges I faced included modifying queries to
prevent SQL injection and balancing performance with usability, especially when
adding database indexes. Despite these challenges, the process helped me polish
my skills in software design, security, and database management.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:200%'>In conclusion, enhancing the event
tracking app allowed me to apply and refine my knowledge in software
development and database management. The improvements made to the app in terms
of security, performance, and error handling helped to demonstrate my ability
to design a solution that effectively balances multiple design considerations.</p>
